## 📝 Solution Template
Every markdown file in this repository follows a consistent structure to ensure clarity:
1. **Problem Statement:** A brief description of the challenge.
2. **Approach:** Explanation of the logic (Brute Force vs. Optimized).
3. **Complexity:** * Time Complexity: $O(n)$
    * Space Complexity: $O(1)$
4. **Code:** Syntax-highlighted implementation.
