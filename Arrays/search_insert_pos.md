# Search Insert Position

> Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found.
> If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
> You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

> Runtime Complexity O(LogN)

```python
def searchInsert(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    low = 0
    high = len(nums) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = low + (high - low)//2
        if nums[mid]==target:
            return mid
        elif nums[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return low
```
